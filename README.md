## React Fundamental Concepts Used

This project demonstrates the following React concepts:

1. **Components**: The core building blocks of the app, both class-based and functional.
2. **State Management**: Managing component state using `useState` and `useReducer`.
3. **Props**: Passing data between parent and child components.
4. **Hooks**: Using `useEffect` for side effects, and `useState` for local component state.
5. **Event Handling**: Handling user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, etc.
6. **Conditional Rendering**: Rendering UI conditionally based on the component state or props.
7. **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding lifecycle methods in class components (if applicable) and `useEffect` for functional components.
8. **Context API**: For global state management.
9. **React Router**: For navigating between different views or pages within the app.
10. **Forms & Validation**: Handling user inputs, form submissions, and validation logic.

## Data Handling & Management

For data handling and state management, the following technologies/methods are used:

- **Context API**: Used for managing global state across the app.
- **Local Storage**: Used for persisting data across sessions.
- **State Management**: `useState` and `useReducer` are used for local component states.

## Features of the Website/Project

Here are 5 key features of the website/project:

1. **User Authentication**: Allows users to sign up, log in, and log out. User session is maintained using local storage.
2. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
3. **Real-time Data Updates**: The application updates data in real-time without requiring page reloads (using React hooks and Context API).
4. **Interactive Charts/Graphs**: Displays dynamic and interactive charts (using libraries like `recharts`).
5. **Search Functionality**: Enables users to search through data, filtering results based on specific criteria.
